.SH HISTORY
HamClock was introduced in QST October 2017. 
At that time it only worked on a standalone hardware configuration consisting of an Espressif ESP8266
microcontroller and 800x480 LCD touch display. 
In 2020 it was ported to the Raspberry Pi platform or any other UNIX-like operating system
running the X11 Window display system.
In 2022 it was ported again to be a web server that can be displayed and controlled
using any browser, with no need for X11.
All configurations continue to be supported although the ESP is not longer being maintained.
