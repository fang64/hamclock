This is a mirror/archive of the source code of [HamClock](https://clearskyinstitute.com/ham/HamClock), primarily intended for use in maintaining the AUR and PACSTALL packages. Forked from [HamClock](https://github.com/kj7rrv/hamclock) previous maintainer, [KJ7RRV](https://github.com/kj7rrv).

* HamClock's update system is disabled in the AUR packages (but *not* in this repo). This is intentional.
* If you have a problem with HamClock itself, and it is not related to updates, see the link above.
* Please do not submit pull requests to this repo.
* Please note that this repo and the AUR and PACSTALL packages should rarely be out of date by more than a couple days. If it is out-of-odate, it is most likely due to being on vacation or because I am busy with other projects or work. Issues and Flags will not do any good.
